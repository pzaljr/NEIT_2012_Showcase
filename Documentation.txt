Capstone 1 & 2: Chronobrawl is a sci-fi themed, arcade style fighter game.  In these screenshots we see Redbot and Bluebot facing off in the demo level as our scientists work around the clock to finish the other battlefields.

Flash 1: "Oh Snap, Zombies!" is a Work In Progress shooter gallery game in which you face the apocalypse with nothing but your trusty shotgun.
 
Flash 2: Oh Snap, Zombies credit screen.  I enjoyed doing the graphic art for this scene.  (Little known fact: "Snap" covers up another word, but it's also a homage to my Game Design class' first photoshop teacher Mr. Ares).

Mod 1: 2-Team Payload Crusade: Red church.  This is a WIP Team Fortress 2 map/mod I look forward to completing.  It faces two teams off defending their faux-religion church.  Blue team must push the bomb cart (as is often the goal in TF2) from Purgatory, through an underwater river and under a pantheon, betweeen two monuments and finally into the church.  

Mod2: 2TPL-Crusade's purgatory.  The bomb can be pushed both ways by each team.  In this shot you see two world's colliding; the cliff walls stretch out into infinity.  Each team has a spawn room nearby the cart's initial spot, and must tread carefully as not to fall into the void.
